Designing and printing paper maps for the general public, aimed at :
- letting everyone know the huge diversity of destinations – either cities or natural places – accessible by public transport
- promoting rail travel and tourism
- providing a low-tech solution for getting information (paper maps, who would have thought)
- changing our way of seeing maps, geography and landscapes, for a world with much less cars.
Let us move for CAR TO TRAIN !
