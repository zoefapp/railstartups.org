When traveling by train, often I just don't want to get somewhere fastest. Perhaps I want to visit a friend along the way or spend a lovely afternoon exploring a place along my route. But to make that happen, time and time again I end up fighting with travel planning tools and routing engines that try to give me the "optimal", the fastest itinerary, rather than the one I really want.

With Trans Europe Planner I can visually explore my options, move parts of the journey around, try things out, get a feeling for what itinerary might work for me. And finally find the one that suits me best.
