Since 2018, I've been sharing my good addresses and ideas for car-free getaways in the Strasbourg region (Alsace + Black Forest), where I'm originally from.
Over the last few years, I've broadened my horizons by developing video and proposing to travel across Europe by train. This has enabled me to reach a wider French-speaking audience in France, Belgium and Switzerland.
My contents are complemented by short videos (Instagram, Tik Tok, Facebook, Youtube) and enriched articles, designed as a mini-guide to provide everyone with all the practical information they need for a European or local getaway.
