We are not the only night train fans. Anyone who has ever traveled by night train will tell you enthusiastically about the adventure on board. It's a great way to travel, because stress doesn't exist when you get closer to your destination while you sleep. Plus, it's better for the Earth than many other forms of travel.
Our mission is to add a new train connection every year. More and more people will leave the plane, car or bus behind and discover more destinations by night.
