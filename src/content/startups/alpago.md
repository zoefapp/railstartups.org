Alpago is a peer-to-peer marketplace for train ticket resale, designed to give travelers a second chance when plans change.
Many train tickets in Europe are non-refundable or non-exchangeable, which leads to frustration, financial loss, and wasted seats. Alpago solves this by connecting people who can no longer use their tickets with those looking for last-minute travel options — all through a secure, easy-to-use platform.
Our mission is to bring flexibility, transparency, and circularity to rail travel. By enabling ticket exchanges between individuals, Alpago not only helps people save money, but also reduces travel-related waste and supports low-carbon transportation.
With features like instant ticket listing, secure payment, identity verification (KYC), and no hidden fees, Alpago is building trust in a market traditionally plagued by scams and uncertainty.
We’re active in France and expanding across Europe to make train travel more accessible, more sustainable, and more human.
